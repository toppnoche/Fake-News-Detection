# Fake News Detection

In this repo. we will classify news into fake or not fake

## Documentation

We preprocess our data using 2 different techniques:-

1) Porter Stemmer
2) Normal preprocessing



# The accuracy achived in both cases is high but the main priority is that there is less "False Positive" so we apply ensemble learning on both the preprocessings and recall if high
